# SionCore

A small game entine built on top of [Libgdx](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx) and [Ashley](https://github.com/stbachmann/ashley). SionCore is compatible with the desktop, Android and iOS platforms.

The engine is under heavy development and is subject to change. Although, I use it for my personal projects and game jams, it's general enough to serve others.

Licensed under [MIT]().

## How to use

As of now, SionCore doesn't have a proper system to manage dependencies. Every used library is included in the repository.

1. Clone the repository
2. Import the project into Eclipse
3. Add `sioncore` to your Libgdx core project build path
4. Link the platform specific Libgdx jar files from the corresponding projects

Most modules are either fairly well documented or self-explanatory.

SionCore uses and exposes:

* Libgdx
* Ashley
* Spine
* Universal Tween Engine
* JavaCSV
